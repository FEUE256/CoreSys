# Latast NOTICE (Todays topic: LICENSE)

We here at the FÈUE team has been thinking to switch to the custom **FÈUE License**.

So as from 2026-02-20 we are going from **MIT-** to **FÈUE-** License.
This is the final LICENSE act from FÈUE.

The FÈUE license is just now in version: 1V

From now use the FÈUE license, for older forks/copys you can use the MIT license to **2026-03-01**. Under this time change the license file in your fork or pull it from github, for local copys just redownload the project and delete the MIT version or change `LICENSE` and `LICENSE.md` files to the verion on Github.
