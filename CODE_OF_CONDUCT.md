# CoreSys Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The CoreSys project is committed to fostering a professional, respectful, and harassment-free environment for everyone. We value technical excellence, constructive collaboration, and open discussion conducted with professionalism and mutual respect.

All contributors, maintainers, and participants are expected to uphold these standards in all project spaces, both online and offline.

## Expected Behavior

Participants in the CoreSys community are expected to:

- Communicate in a respectful and professional manner  
- Provide constructive feedback and accept feedback gracefully  
- Focus discussions on technical merit and project improvement  
- Show consideration for different experience levels and perspectives  
- Use clear, inclusive, and appropriate language  

Technical disagreement is natural and encouraged, but it must address ideas rather than individuals.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated in any CoreSys project space, including repositories, issue trackers, discussions, chat platforms, or events:

- Harassment, discrimination, or hateful conduct of any kind  
- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory remarks  
- Threats, intimidation, or deliberate disruption of discussions  
- Sharing private or sensitive information without explicit permission  
- Trolling, provocation, or intentionally inflammatory behavior  
- Any conduct that would be considered unprofessional in a workplace or academic environment  

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all CoreSys community spaces and whenever an individual is representing the CoreSys project or its community.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it privately to the project maintainers. Reports should include:

- A clear description of the incident  
- When and where it occurred  
- Any relevant evidence such as screenshots, logs, or links  

All reports will be handled confidentially and reviewed in a fair and objective manner.
